<p>Updated ${modifiedDate}</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.nakama.in/authors/yash-kumar" rel="author">Yash Kumar</a>, Co-founder and CEO, Nakama Growth</p>
<figure><img src="/journal/minuttia-alternatives/minuttia-alternatives-hero.png" alt="Minuttia alternatives 2026: seven AEO agencies compared on five weighted criteria" width="1600" height="900" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async"></figure>
<p>Minuttia is a B2B SaaS AEO agency that also runs its own AI visibility tracker, a free AEO report and paid AI Overviews audits. Buyers look at alternatives to Minuttia when they want a different mix of AI-search execution, off-site citations, pilot size or measurement. We scored seven agencies and Minuttia on the same criteria. Prices and scopes change, so check each firm's site before you buy.</p>
<p>Sorted by the scores below, the seven Minuttia alternatives are Daydream, Nakama Growth, Skale, Omniscient Digital, Breaking B2B, Graphite and Rock The Rankings.</p>
<figure><img src="/journal/minuttia-alternatives/minuttia-alternatives-quick-picks.png" alt="Three Minuttia alternatives by fit: Daydream, Nakama Growth and Skale" width="1600" height="900" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></figure>
<h2 id="why-do-buyers-look-for-minuttia-alternatives">Why do buyers look for Minuttia alternatives?</h2>
<p>Most teams that shop alternatives to Minuttia are not unhappy with the work. They want a different shape of engagement: a smaller first step than a retainer, more work in the third-party sources AI engines read, or an agency that does not take over the whole content program. Budget and contract model are the other common reasons.</p>
<p>Minuttia does not publish retainer pricing on its site. Clutch lists a $5,000+ minimum project size and a $100 to $149 hourly rate, and its most common reviewed project size is $10,000 to $49,999. For an early-stage SaaS team, that can be a large first commitment before they know which AI engines mention them at all.</p>
<p>Minuttia's model is broad. Its homepage lists Google and AI search strategy, human content, AI content and programmatic SEO, digital PR, Reddit marketing, and agent analytics. Some teams want exactly that. Others already have an in-house content team and only need help with placement and citations.</p>
<p>The free AEO report is useful but narrow by design. Minuttia's own FAQ says citations in the free report are currently tracked for Perplexity only, and query fan-outs are not in the free report yet. Teams that want ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews citation data from day one may look elsewhere or pay for more.</p>
<p>None of these are complaints about quality. Minuttia reports 94% average client retention (as of June 2026) and holds a 4.9 Clutch rating across 16 reviews. People switch for fit, not because the agency failed.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-ranked-these-minuttia-alternatives">How we ranked these Minuttia alternatives</h2>
<p>We scored every agency, including Minuttia as a reference, on five criteria weighted for buyers who already looked at Minuttia and want placement-led, pilotable AI visibility work. This is not a universal agency score. A team that wants a full content factory should weight these differently and would likely get a different order.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-minuttia-and-who-is-it-for">What is Minuttia and who is it for?</h2>
<p>Minuttia is a B2B SaaS SEO, AEO and content marketing agency founded in 2020. It pairs a full-service program (strategy, human and AI-assisted content, digital PR, Reddit marketing) with a proprietary AI visibility tracker covering ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity. It is the reference point every agency on this list is measured against.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Founded:</strong> 2020, per Clutch and its llms.txt. Clutch lists HQ in Tallinn, Estonia, with a remote team.</li><li><strong>Leadership:</strong> George Chasiotis (Founder) and Zacharias Xiroudakis (Managing Director).</li><li><strong>Measurement:</strong> its tracker reports visibility, share of voice, position and sentiment by topic. The free AEO report also checks robots.txt and llms.txt accessibility.</li><li><strong>AI Overviews audits:</strong> one-off packages by page count: $1,075 (100 to 250 pages), $2,475 (251 to 500) and $5,475 (501 to 1,000).</li><li><strong>Proof:</strong> public case studies include Respona, LearnWorlds and Toggl. Its <a href="https://minuttia.com/case-studies/meilisearch/">Meilisearch case study</a> reports a 665% increase in LLM-driven traffic.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> the free report's citation layer is Perplexity-only, and there is no self-serve or public agency pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you are an established B2B SaaS company that wants one agency to own SEO, AEO, content and measurement together.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you want a small pilot, or you already run content in-house and only need off-site placement.</p>
<h2 id="1-what-is-daydream">1. What is Daydream?</h2>
<p>Daydream is a SaaS-focused SEO and AI-search agency that combines specialists with AI agents to run programmatic and AI visibility programs. It is the closest like-for-like swap for Minuttia, which is why it scores highest among the alternatives. It suits funded SaaS teams that want a similar program with a stronger programmatic SEO engine.</p>
<ul><li>Combines AI agents with dedicated experts (its own wording: "a proven methodology with AI agents and dedicated experts").</li><li>Strong programmatic SEO focus alongside AI search visibility.</li><li>Client logos and case studies on its site include Clay, Beautiful.ai and Twingate.</li><li>Pricing is not published on its site.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standout:</strong> programmatic depth plus AI visibility in one program.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> focused on Series A and later SaaS, so smaller teams may not fit the model or budget.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you like Minuttia's shape but want more programmatic page scale.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you are pre-seed, or your main gap is off-site citations rather than on-site pages.</p>
<h2 id="2-what-is-nakama-growth">2. What is Nakama Growth?</h2>
<p>Nakama Growth is an AEO and GEO agency for tech, SaaS and AI companies that focuses on the off-site sources AI engines cite. Its work spans editorial placements, review platforms, video and community presence, plus digital PR and YouTube run end to end. It fits best when you need off-site citations and want to start with an audit, not a retainer. See Nakama's <a href="/services/aeo">AEO services</a>.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Off-site citation system:</strong> editorial, review, video and community channels, with YouTube handled from scripting to publishing, plus digital PR. Nakama Growth does not edit client product sites.</li><li><strong>Answer-first off-site assets:</strong> placements shaped so AI engines can cite them (reviews, editorial, video), not on-site page rewrites.</li><li><strong>Entry point:</strong> starts with a GEO audit that maps where ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini and AI Overviews mention you today. See the <a href="/journal/geo-audit">GEO audit guide</a>.</li><li><strong>Named clients:</strong> Synup, Inventive AI, HubEngage and StarAgile.</li><li><strong>ICP:</strong> tech, SaaS and AI only. Local businesses and hotels are out of scope.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standout:</strong> off-site citation work as the core service, not an add-on.</p>
<p><strong>How it differs from Skale:</strong> Skale also runs off-site citation outreach, but as an add-on to its SaaS SEO systems. Nakama Growth works only off-site, does not run a classic SEO or content program, handles YouTube end to end, and starts with a GEO audit rather than a retainer.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> founded in 2026, so its public case-study history is much shorter than Minuttia's 2020-era record. It also has no proprietary tracker; measurement runs on partner tools and a reporting framework.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> your blog is in decent shape and the gap is presence in the third-party sources AI answers draw from.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you want one vendor to run your full classic SEO, content operations and its own tracking product.</p>
<h2 id="3-what-is-skale">3. What is Skale?</h2>
<p>Skale is a SaaS-only SEO agency known for repeatable growth systems and programmatic SEO. It has added a standalone AI Brand Mentions service, which makes it a credible Minuttia alternative for teams that want SEO scale first and AI visibility layered on. According to MADX, it was also the top pick on MADX's own Minuttia alternatives list.</p>
<ul><li>Works only with SaaS companies.</li><li>Strong in programmatic SEO and content systems at volume.</li><li>Runs a dedicated AI Brand Mentions service: monthly off-site citation outreach for placements in the listicles, review and comparison pages and YouTube overviews that AI engines cite. That overlaps the off-site lane Nakama Growth works in.</li><li>Custom pricing; no public rate card.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standout:</strong> proven SaaS SEO systems and page-volume execution.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> SaaS-only and retainer-led. AI Brand Mentions sits alongside its SEO systems as an add-on rather than the core of the engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you need high page volume and steady organic growth, with off-site AI mentions handled by the same team.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you are outside SaaS or want an AI-search-first agency.</p>
<h2 id="4-what-is-omniscient-digital">4. What is Omniscient Digital?</h2>
<p>Omniscient Digital is a B2B organic growth agency covering SEO, GEO, programmatic SEO and digital PR. It is senior-led and broad, which suits larger budgets that want strategy and PR together. Its PR work gives it a solid off-site score, but the entry cost keeps it out of the pilot-friendly group.</p>
<ul><li>Covers SEO, GEO, programmatic SEO and PR in one engagement.</li><li>Senior strategists lead accounts.</li><li>Full-service engagements start at $120,000 per year, per its own site.</li><li>Publishes B2B case studies on its site (e.g. Teambridge).</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standout:</strong> strategy and digital PR under one senior team.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> high entry cost, with little room for a small pilot.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you have a larger B2B budget and want strategy, content and PR from one partner.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you need to test AI visibility work before committing a yearly budget.</p>
<h2 id="5-what-is-breaking-b2b">5. What is Breaking B2B?</h2>
<p>Breaking B2B is a bottom-funnel SaaS SEO and AI search agency that ties content to demo pipeline. It writes product-led, conversion-focused pages rather than top-of-funnel volume. It suits mid-market SaaS teams that measure success in demos booked, and it scores lower on off-site citation work.</p>
<ul><li>Bottom-funnel, pipeline-first content strategy.</li><li>Covers AI search alongside SEO.</li><li>Pricing page lists plans from $6,000 per month on a 12-month term ($6,500 on 6 months), plus a lighter $4,600/month plan on 12 months.</li><li>Terms are 6 or 12 months.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standout:</strong> content tied directly to pipeline metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> longer terms and a monthly floor above Minuttia's reported minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> demo pipeline is your north star and you want product-led pages.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you want a short pilot or mostly off-site citation work.</p>
<h2 id="6-what-is-graphite">6. What is Graphite?</h2>
<p>Graphite is a growth agency and platform that runs SEO and AEO programs at scale for mid-market and enterprise brands. It is a strong option when you need production and reporting across very large sites. For smaller SaaS teams, it is often more machine than they need.</p>
<ul><li>SEO and AEO at scale, supported by its own tooling.</li><li>Clients named on its homepage include Webflow, n8n and Hinge Health.</li><li>Pricing is not published.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standout:</strong> scale and process for large content programs.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> likely overkill for small teams, with limited pilot options.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you run a large site and need AEO across thousands of pages.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you are early stage or want hands-on off-site work.</p>
<h2 id="7-what-is-rock-the-rankings">7. What is Rock The Rankings?</h2>
<p>Rock The Rankings is a founder-led SaaS SEO agency where most clients start with a 90-day program, with no lock-in after that. That makes it one of the easier agencies to try. It suits smaller SaaS teams that want direct senior attention, though its off-site citation focus is lighter than others here.</p>
<ul><li>Founder-led, hands-on engagement.</li><li>Most clients start with a 90-Day Program; no lock-in after it (12-month terms are discounted).</li><li>Tracks visibility across major LLMs, per its homepage.</li><li>SaaS focus.</li><li>Pricing not published on the homepage.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Standout:</strong> a 90-day start and senior attention for smaller teams.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> less emphasis on off-site citation building than citation-led shops.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you want a low-lock-in SEO partner and AI search is a secondary goal.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> earning citations in third-party sources is your main AI visibility goal.</p>
<h2 id="minuttia-vs-nakama-growth-what-is-the-practical-difference">Minuttia vs Nakama Growth: what is the practical difference?</h2>
<p>Minuttia is a full-service B2B SaaS agency that owns content, SEO, AEO and measurement with its own tracker. Nakama Growth is narrower: it focuses on off-site citation channels (it does not take over your product site) and starts with a GEO audit. The choice depends on whether your gap is full-service content ownership or presence in the sources AI engines read.</p>

<h2 id="which-minuttia-alternative-should-you-pick">Which Minuttia alternative should you pick?</h2>
<p>Pick by what you are swapping for. If you want the same program with more scale, look at Daydream or Skale. If the gap is citations outside your site, Nakama Growth fits. Bigger budgets suit Omniscient Digital or Graphite, pipeline focus suits Breaking B2B, and low lock-in suits Rock The Rankings.</p>

<h2 id="when-should-you-stay-with-minuttia">When should you stay with Minuttia?</h2>
<p>Stay with Minuttia if you value one partner for SEO, AEO, content and measurement, and its tracker already gives you the reporting you need. Its retention figures and long case-study record are real strengths. Switching makes sense only when your gap is clearly elsewhere.</p>
<ul><li>You want the agency to own your full content program.</li><li>You rely on its proprietary tracker and AI Overviews audits.</li><li>Your budget fits a retainer and you value its long SaaS track record.</li></ul>
<h2 id="how-we-compared">How we compared</h2>
<p>We checked each agency's own site, Clutch, llms.txt files and third-party roundups (RankAI, MADX) on 25 October 2026. We did not buy services or test trackers. Prices were checked on each agency's own site. Scores reflect public information, not client outcomes.</p>
<p>Background reading: <a href="/journal/aeo-vs-seo-vs-geo">AEO vs SEO vs GEO</a> and our <a href="/journal/answer-engine-optimization">answer engine optimization playbook</a>. If you are comparing generative engine optimization services more broadly, the <a href="/journal/best-geo-agencies-for-saas">wider SaaS GEO agency shortlist</a> covers more firms.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-only-need-a-tracker">If you only need a tracker</h3>
<p>Some teams leaving the free AEO report only need monitoring, not an agency. In that case, a self-serve AI visibility tool is cheaper. See our <a href="/journal/peec-ai-alternatives">Peec AI alternatives</a> for options.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-people-ask-about-minuttia-alternatives">What do people ask about Minuttia alternatives?</h2>
<h3 id="what-does-minuttia-do">What does Minuttia do?</h3>
<p>Minuttia is a B2B SaaS agency for SEO, AEO and content marketing. It runs strategy, human and AI-assisted content, digital PR and Reddit marketing, and it offers a proprietary AI visibility tracker for ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity, a free AEO report, and paid AI Overviews audits.</p>
<h3 id="is-minuttia-an-agency-or-a-software-tool">Is Minuttia an agency or a software tool?</h3>
<p>Minuttia is an agency first. Its AI visibility tracker supports client reporting and the free AEO report, but it is not sold as a self-serve SaaS product with public plans the way tools like Peec AI are. If you only want software, compare AI visibility tools instead.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-main-minuttia-competitors-for-b2b-saas">What are the main Minuttia competitors for B2B SaaS?</h3>
<p>The main Minuttia competitors for B2B SaaS are Daydream, Skale, Omniscient Digital, Breaking B2B, Graphite and Rock The Rankings. Nakama Growth is a fit for teams focused on off-site citations. The right one depends on budget, pilot size and whether your gap is on-site content or third-party sources.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-does-minuttia-cost">How much does Minuttia cost?</h3>
<p>Minuttia does not publish retainer pricing. Clutch lists a $5,000+ minimum project size and a $100 to $149 hourly rate. Its AI Overviews audits are one-off packages from $1,075 (100 to 250 pages) to $5,475 (501 to 1,000 pages). Ask for a quote for current retainer pricing.</p>
<h3 id="do-minuttia-alternatives-include-ai-visibility-tracking">Do Minuttia alternatives include AI visibility tracking?</h3>
<p>Some do. Minuttia has its own tracker, and Graphite and Daydream report inside their programs. Ask each agency which engines they track, how often, and whether citations are measured for ChatGPT and AI Overviews, not just Perplexity.</p>
<h3 id="should-i-pick-an-agency-or-a-tracker-after-minuttias-free-report">Should I pick an agency or a tracker after Minuttia's free report?</h3>
<p>Pick a tracker if you only need to monitor mentions and have a team to act on the data. Pick an agency if you need someone to change what AI engines say, through content, citations and PR. Many teams start with an audit to decide.</p>

   "By Yash Kumar, Co-founder and CEO, Nakama Growth",
   "Minuttia is a B2B SaaS AEO agency that also runs its own AI visibility tracker, a free AEO report and paid AI Overviews audits. Buyers look at alternatives to Minuttia when they want a different mix of AI-search execution, off-site citations, pilot size or measurement. We scored seven agencies and Minuttia on the same criteria. Prices and scopes change, so check each firm's site before you buy.",
   "Sorted by the scores below, the seven Minuttia alternatives are Daydream, Nakama Growth, Skale, Omniscient Digital, Breaking B2B, Graphite and Rock The Rankings."
  ]
 },
 {
  "heading": "Why do buyers look for Minuttia alternatives?",
  "paragraphs": [
   "Most teams that shop alternatives to Minuttia are not unhappy with the work. They want a different shape of engagement: a smaller first step than a retainer, more work in the third-party sources AI engines read, or an agency that does not take over the whole content program. Budget and contract model are the other common reasons.",
   "Minuttia does not publish retainer pricing on its site. Clutch lists a $5,000+ minimum project size and a $100 to $149 hourly rate, and its most common reviewed project size is $10,000 to $49,999. For an early-stage SaaS team, that can be a large first commitment before they know which AI engines mention them at all.",
   "Minuttia's model is broad. Its homepage lists Google and AI search strategy, human content, AI content and programmatic SEO, digital PR, Reddit marketing, and agent analytics. Some teams want exactly that. Others already have an in-house content team and only need help with placement and citations.",
   "The free AEO report is useful but narrow by design. Minuttia's own FAQ says citations in the free report are currently tracked for Perplexity only, and query fan-outs are not in the free report yet. Teams that want ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews citation data from day one may look elsewhere or pay for more.",
   "None of these are complaints about quality. Minuttia reports 94% average client retention (as of June 2026) and holds a 4.9 Clutch rating across 16 reviews. People switch for fit, not because the agency failed."

 {
  "heading": "How we ranked these Minuttia alternatives",
  "paragraphs": [
   "We scored every agency, including Minuttia as a reference, on five criteria weighted for buyers who already looked at Minuttia and want placement-led, pilotable AI visibility work. This is not a universal agency score. A team that wants a full content factory should weight these differently and would likely get a different order.",
   "Criterion | What it means | Weight",
   "Off-site citation channels | Work in editorial, review, video and community sources, plus digital PR, that AI engines draw on | 25%",
   "Pilotable engagement | Can you start with an audit or pilot instead of a long retainer? | 20%",
   "AI-search execution depth | Answer-first content, entity work, llms.txt and AI Overviews readiness, not an SEO rebrand | 20%",
   "Proof | Named clients and dated, public case studies | 20%",
