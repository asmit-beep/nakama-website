<h2 id="what-do-the-best-ai-seo-agencies-actually-do">What do the best AI SEO agencies actually do?</h2>
<p>The best AI SEO agencies get your brand found in Google and named inside AI answers from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini and Google AI Overviews. AI-written blog posts are not the same thing. This guide compares 9 AI SEO agencies for US SaaS buyers using each agency's own site, checked 28 October 2026.</p>
<blockquote><p>AI SEO agency, defined. An AI SEO agency is a search agency that optimizes for two surfaces at once: classic Google rankings and the answers AI assistants write. It researches the prompts buyers type, structures pages so AI tools can quote them, earns mentions on the third-party sources those tools cite, and tracks how often your brand shows up.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best AI SEO agency for you depends on what you need most:</p>
<ul><li>Breaking B2B: B2B SaaS teams that want pipeline-focused SEO and AI search with published tiers.</li><li>Nakama Growth: SaaS, AI and software brands that need to be named through off-site sources such as YouTube, Reddit, review sites and digital PR.</li><li>Discovered Labs: B2B SaaS teams that want month-to-month terms and an in-house AI visibility tracker.</li><li>MADX Digital: teams that want a fixed number of AI-cited placements every month at a published price.</li><li>Maximus Labs: growth-stage SaaS and AI companies that want the lowest published entry price on this list.</li></ul>
<p>Agency pages and prices checked 28 October 2026; Breaking B2B, MADX Digital, Discovered Labs, Minuttia and Omniscient Digital rechecked 11 November 2026. Ranking updated 11 Nov 2026.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>
<ul><li>6 of the 9 AI SEO companies on this list show a price figure on their own site. Entry points range from USD 3,999 a month (Maximus Labs) to an average above USD 20,000 a month across all services (NoGood).</li><li>Only 1 of the 9 publish AI-answer proof tied to a specific query a buyer can re-run today: Nakama Growth.</li><li>3 agencies on Minuttia's own list (Breaking B2B, MADX Digital and Maximus Labs) now show different prices on their own sites than that list states. Always check the agency's pricing page, not a roundup, including this one.</li><li>No agency can guarantee a spot in ChatGPT or Google AI Overviews. MADX Digital says so on its own pricing page. Treat a guarantee as a red flag.</li><li>Google says no special schema or AI text file is needed to appear in AI Overviews or AI Mode. An "AI SEO package" that is only markup is not enough.</li></ul>

<p>The 9 best AI SEO agencies in 2026, by our evidence checks, are Nakama Growth, Discovered Labs, MADX Digital, Maximus Labs, Breaking B2B, Omniscient Digital, Minuttia, NoGood and Victorious.

<h2 id="how-did-we-rank-these-ai-seo-agencies">How did we rank these AI SEO agencies?</h2>
<p>We scored each AI SEO agency on five checks you can verify yourself, using only its own website on 28 October 2026, with a recheck of Breaking B2B, MADX Digital, Discovered Labs, Minuttia and Omniscient Digital on 11 November 2026. Each check is Yes, Partial or No. We did not use paid directories, review scores or invented point totals. Proof and off-site work come first, because they decide whether an AI answer changes.</p>
<p>The five checks:</p>
<ol><li>Checkable AI answer proof. Yes: a named client with an AI answer result and the query behind it, so you can re-run it. Partial: a named client and metric without the query, or a query without a client. No: none found.</li><li>Off-site citation work. Yes: placements on the third-party sources AI tools cite, such as listicles, reviews, Reddit, YouTube or press, sold as a core service. Partial: links or PR without an AI citation focus.</li><li>Measurement across named AI engines. Yes: its own tracker or named engines tracked on a schedule. Partial: reporting without named engines or a third-party tool only.</li><li>SaaS and B2B tech fit. Yes: SaaS, B2B or AI named as a core market. Partial: one market among many.</li><li>Published price. Yes: a price for the service on its own site. Partial: an average or a figure covering all services. No: none.</li></ol>
<p>Agencies are ordered by Yes answers in checks 1 and 2, then Partial answers there, then the same counts for checks 3 to 5. Ties are alphabetical.</p>

<p>Notes on the matrix:</p>
<ul><li>Nakama Growth is the only agency that ties a named client to an AI-answer query a buyer can re-run. Its Work page lists the exact searches behind five clients' placements, with a button to re-run each one. Breaking B2B's <a href="https://www.breakingb2b.com/customer-results/proposify">Proposify case study</a> names the Google head term 'proposal software' and reports AI search visitors up 91% (self-reported), not an AI-answer query a buyer can re-run.</li><li>Nakama Growth wins the off-site check most broadly: YouTube end to end, disclosed Reddit and Quora participation, Medium, Substack and LinkedIn placements, digital PR and G2 review presence sit in one plan. It loses on price (custom quote) and on measurement (partner tools, no own tracker).</li><li>Discovered Labs, MADX Digital and Maximus Labs tie on the same pattern and are listed alphabetically.</li><li>Minuttia's price is No because no price appears on its own site. Clutch's USD 5,000+ minimum is third-party.</li><li>NoGood's price is Partial because the USD 20,000+ figure is an average across all its services.</li></ul>
<p>Every entry below includes a weakness.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-ai-seo-agency">What is an AI SEO agency?</h2>
<p>An AI SEO agency, sometimes searched as an SEO AI agency, optimizes a brand for both search engines and AI assistants. It wins Google rankings and also gets the brand named, cited and recommended in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Google AI Overviews and AI Mode. The goal is visibility wherever buyers ask, not faster blog output.</p>
<p>The label covers two very different kinds of company, and buyers should know which one they are talking to:</p>
<ul><li>AI-assisted SEO shops. Classic SEO agencies that use AI tools for keyword clustering, briefs and drafts. AI makes them faster. Visibility inside AI answers is a side effect.</li><li>AI-first SEO agencies. Agencies built around AI answer visibility. They start from buyer prompts, track named engines, and earn mentions on the sources AI tools cite. You will also see them called generative AI SEO agencies, AI LLM SEO agencies or AI-powered SEO agencies.</li></ul>
<p>This guide favors the second kind. The shift is real. In a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/">Pew Research Center study</a> of US browsing in March 2025, 18% of Google searches produced an AI summary. Users clicked a regular result in 8% of visits to those pages, against 15% on pages without one.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-ai-seo-different-from-seo-aeo-and-geo">How is AI SEO different from SEO, AEO and GEO?</h2>
<p>AI SEO is the umbrella term buyers use for search work that covers Google and AI answers together. SEO ranks your pages. AEO, answer engine optimization, shapes pages so AI tools can quote them. GEO, generative engine optimization, works on the third-party sources AI tools cite. A good AI SEO agency does all three.</p>

<p>Google's own guidance says that, from its side, optimizing for generative AI search is still SEO. That is why the best AI SEO companies keep strong SEO fundamentals underneath. For answer-page tactics, see our guide to the <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/best-aeo-agencies">best AEO agencies</a>. For off-site citation shortlists, see our <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/best-generative-engine-optimization-agencies">best GEO agencies</a> guide and the <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/best-geo-agencies-for-saas">best GEO agencies for SaaS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-ai-seo-agency-services-include">What do AI SEO agency services include?</h2>
<p>AI SEO agency services usually combine seven parts: an AI visibility baseline, prompt and keyword mapping, answer-first content, technical access, off-site citations, entity consistency and reporting. Agencies differ most on off-site work and measurement, so ask which of the seven each one actually delivers.</p>
<ol><li>AI visibility baseline. Which prompts, engines and competitors show your brand today.</li><li>Prompt and keyword mapping. The searches and AI prompts buyers use at each buying stage.</li><li>Answer-first content. Pages that state the answer in the first lines, with comparison tables and cited evidence. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735">GEO paper</a> from Princeton and IIT Delhi researchers (KDD 2024) found that adding citations, quotations and statistics raised visibility in generative engine answers by up to 40% in its benchmark. Keyword stuffing did little.</li><li>Technical access. Pages indexed, AI crawlers allowed (OpenAI says to allow OAI-SearchBot to appear in ChatGPT search), schema matching visible text.</li><li>Off-site citations. Listicles, review sites, Reddit, YouTube and press. Pew found Wikipedia, YouTube and Reddit made up 15% of sources listed in Google AI summaries.</li><li>Entity consistency. The same product facts and category across your site, profiles and listings.</li><li>Reporting. Mentions, citations, share of voice, AI referral traffic and pipeline, with links to the raw answers.</li></ol>
<h2 id="how-do-the-9-best-ai-seo-agencies-compare-in-detail">How do the 9 best AI SEO agencies compare in detail?</h2>
<p>Each entry uses the same format: best for, services, strength, pricing, weakness, and when to choose or skip. Figures come from each agency's own site on 28 October 2026, with the recheck named above. "Self-reported" means we could not verify the number independently. Use the weakness line to rule agencies out fast.</p>
<h3 id="1-nakama-growth">1. Nakama Growth</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> SaaS, AI and software brands that need to be named when buyers ask AI tools what to choose, through off-site sources.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> One plan covers six services: GEO, AEO, Reddit and community, content and editorial, YouTube and video, and digital PR and links. The pricing page lists a buyer prompt map, AI visibility tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini and Google AI Overviews, a competitor and source audit, disclosed Reddit and Quora participation, YouTube scripts and edits, Medium, Substack and LinkedIn placements, outreach to listicles AI engines cite, and G2 review presence. See Nakama's <a href="https://www.nakama.in/services/geo">generative engine optimization services</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Off-site citation work you can check. The Work page lists five clients, including Synup, Inventive AI, HubEngage and StarAgile, with the exact searches where the work surfaced and a button to run each one. YouTube is handled from scripting to publishing, which few AI SEO agencies on this list do in-house. Every community post is disclosed and nothing publishes without the client's sign-off.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> No price published. One all-inclusive plan with no tiers or add-ons. A written proposal arrives within two business days of a 15-minute pricing call. Minimum commitment is three months.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Founded in 2026, so the public record is short. The Work page shows placements and queries but no performance metrics. It has no proprietary tracker. It is based in India, so US calls need time zone planning, and a large site that needs deep technical SEO may need a specialist for that part.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> your site is in decent shape and the gap is presence in the third-party sources AI answers draw from.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you want one vendor to run classic technical SEO and its own tracking product.</p>
<h3 id="2-discovered-labs">2. Discovered Labs</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> B2B SaaS teams that want flexible terms and an in-house tracker.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> AI visibility tracking across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and Google AI Overviews, plus Google and Bing. Content, Reddit marketing, link building and technical readiness. It also publishes free tools such as an AEO content evaluator.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Flexible terms. Retainers run month to month, and a 3 or 6 month commitment lowers the rate. Its one-off diagnostic is credited to the first retainer month if you sign within 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Establish from EUR 6,995 a month on a 6-month commitment, Compete from EUR 10,995 a month, and a EUR 4,370 diagnostic credited to the first month if you sign within 14 days (prices read 11 November 2026, per its <a href="https://discoveredlabs.com/pricing">pricing page</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Proof on its site is testimonials, such as "our referrals from ChatGPT are up 29%" from Passion.io's co-founder, without dates or queries. It measures with its own tracker, so independent checks are up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you want to start month to month.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> your budget is under EUR 7,000 a month.</p>
<h3 id="3-madx-digital">3. MADX Digital</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> SaaS and B2B teams that want a fixed number of AI-cited placements every month.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> Strategy, GEO monitoring, placements in "the guides AI cites", a monthly press release, and on Growth and above, 10 to 20 articles a month and weekly website fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> The most transparent unit pricing here. Its pricing page defines a placement as a live, indexed third-party page that names and links to your brand. It says plainly: "no one can control what an AI model recommends."</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Authority USD 4,500 a month (10 placements), Growth USD 8,500 (adds 10 articles), Scale USD 13,500 (20 and 20), Enterprise from USD 20,000, per its <a href="https://www.madx.digital/pricing">pricing page</a>. All on a 12-month term or a 3-month rolling minimum. A one-off AI search and SEO plan costs USD 4,500.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Authority tracks only ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews and Claude. Minuttia's list still shows MADX packages from USD 2,749, which the current pricing page does not offer.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you want countable placements and published add-ons.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you need Perplexity and Gemini tracking on the entry tier.</p>
<h3 id="4-maximus-labs">4. Maximus Labs</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Growth-stage SaaS, AI and B2B companies that want the lowest published agency price on this list.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> Full-service GEO covering positioning, a prompt baseline on every major AI model, GEO, AEO and B2B SEO pages, technical SEO and crawler access, and earned mentions across PR, reviews, listicles and communities. Inbound only, no paid media.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Its Max Visibility tool, sold separately from USD 79 a month, comes free to agency clients and tracks ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, AI Overviews and AI Mode daily.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Full-service GEO from USD 3,999 a month. Enterprise is custom.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> It is a young agency with a short public track record. "Starting from" pricing depends on scope confirmed on a call. Minuttia's list shows older USD 2,999 and USD 4,999 plans.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you want tracking plus execution at the lowest entry price.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you need a long, independently verified history.</p>
<h3 id="5-breaking-b2b">5. Breaking B2B</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> B2B and SaaS companies that measure AI SEO in demos and pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> Technical SEO, content and strategy, link building, conversion and site structure, Reddit marketing and YouTube marketing, plus dedicated answer engine optimization, generative engine optimization and LLM SEO pages. It works with B2B and SaaS companies only.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Pipeline focus with visible capacity. Every tier on its pricing page lists money keywords and prompts targeted, content pieces per month and link or brand mention credits. Two link credits buy one listicle mention, which makes off-site AI citation work countable. Its reported Proposify result names the Google head term 'proposal software' and reports AI search visitors up 91% (self-reported), not an AI-answer query a buyer can re-run.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Light from USD 4,600 a month on a 12-month term, per its <a href="https://www.breakingb2b.com/pricing">pricing page</a>. Silver USD 6,000 a month on 12 months or USD 6,500 on 6 months (7 content pieces, 4 placement credits). Gold USD 8,000, Growth Team USD 9,000, Diamond USD 10,200, Aggressive Growth USD 15,200, and Category King from USD 20,000 a month.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Terms are 6 or 12 months, so there is no month-to-month test. Its pricing page does not name which AI engines it tracks. Minuttia's roundup still says "no 12-month contracts", which no longer matches the pricing page.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> demo pipeline is your north star and you want countable monthly output.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you want a short pilot first.</p>
<h3 id="6-omniscient-digital">6. Omniscient Digital</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> B2B software companies with a larger organic budget.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> SEO, AEO, content production, digital PR and analytics in one program.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> A named AI result. Its AEO page says it grew Convert's LLM prompt visibility by 81% and AI citation share by 140% in 60 days (self-reported), per its <a href="https://beomniscient.com/blog/aeo-agency/">AEO agency page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Full-service engagements start at USD 120,000 a year, per its <a href="https://beomniscient.com/blog/aeo-agency/">AEO agency page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> The floor is high for a first test. AEO sits inside a broad service menu, so confirm how much budget goes to AI visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you want strategy, content and PR from one senior team.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you need to test before committing USD 120,000 a year.</p>
<h3 id="7-minuttia">7. Minuttia</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Established B2B SaaS brands that want one agency to own SEO, AI search and content.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> Google and AI search strategy, human and AI-assisted content, digital PR, Reddit marketing and agent analytics with its own AI search tracker.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Depth and retention. It reports a <a href="https://minuttia.com/case-studies/meilisearch/">665% increase in LLM-driven traffic for Meilisearch</a> and <a href="https://minuttia.com/">94% average client retention as of June 2026</a> (self-reported).</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Not published on its site. Clutch lists a USD 5,000+ minimum project size (third-party).</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Its own criteria target companies with USD 20M+ ARR or Series A and above, so early startups may not fit. Its free AEO report tracks citations on Perplexity only, per its FAQ. Its AI SEO roundup ranks itself first with no published scoring method.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you want a full content engine with a proprietary tracker.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you are pre-Series A or only need off-site citations.</p>
<h3 id="8-nogood">8. NoGood</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Growth teams that want AI SEO next to paid media, social and creative.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> AEO and SEO for ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity and AI Overviews, plus paid growth, organic social and CRO. It uses the Goodie AI platform for AI visibility tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Big-brand experience. It names AWS, MongoDB, Oura and SteelSeries as clients and reports an <a href="https://nogood.io/">84% client retention rate</a> (self-reported).</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Its FAQ says the average retainer is above USD 20,000 a month across all services.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Premium pricing, and AI SEO is one practice in a broad growth agency.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you want one squad across paid and organic.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you only need an AI SEO specialist.</p>
<h3 id="9-victorious">9. Victorious</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Mid-market and enterprise brands that want AI visibility layered on an established SEO program.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> SEO, AEO for ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Gemini, Copilot and Claude, content and web services, with a quarterly search report.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Recognition and process. Its homepage cites <a href="https://victorious.com/">5x Search Agency of the Year</a> and a UNIONBAY result with 84 new AI Overview citations and 200% organic revenue growth year over year (self-reported).</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Not published on its site.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Its homepage AI result is an apparel brand, not SaaS, and it is a generalist across many industries. Minuttia cites a Clutch minimum of USD 50,000+, which we could not confirm on Victorious's own site.</p>
<p><strong>Choose if:</strong> you run a large SEO program and want AI Overviews added.</p>
<p><strong>Skip if:</strong> you are an early-stage SaaS team.</p>
<h2 id="which-ai-seo-agency-is-best-for-saas-and-startups">Which AI SEO agency is best for SaaS and startups?</h2>
<p>For SaaS and B2B startups, the best AI SEO agencies are ones with a low published entry price, SaaS-only focus and countable monthly output. Maximus Labs, Breaking B2B and MADX Digital publish entry tiers. Nakama Growth fits startups whose main gap is off-site citations and that can commit to three months.</p>
<div class="article-table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Stage</th><th scope="col">Good fits</th><th scope="col">Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seed to Series A</td><td>Maximus Labs, Breaking B2B (Light), Nakama Growth</td><td>Lower entry, SaaS focus, off-site work included</td></tr><tr><td>Series A to C</td><td>Breaking B2B, Discovered Labs, MADX Digital</td><td>Published tiers, tracking, placements</td></tr><tr><td>Series B and up</td><td>Minuttia, Omniscient Digital</td><td>Full content engines, larger budgets</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<h2 id="need-an-enterprise-shortlist">Need an enterprise shortlist?</h2>

This page stays the wider AI SEO agency comparison; that page owns the enterprise criteria.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-an-ai-seo-agency-cost">How much does an AI SEO agency cost?</h2>
<p>AI SEO agency pricing on this list starts at USD 3,999 a month (Maximus Labs) and typically runs USD 4,500 to USD 15,000 a month for full programs. Enterprise tiers start around USD 20,000. Price follows scope: how many placements, articles and AI engines are included, and the contract term.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-choose-the-best-ai-seo-agency">How do you choose the best AI SEO agency?</h2>
<p>Choose the AI SEO agency that can show AI answers it changed, with queries you can re-run, and that works on the sources your category depends on. Ask these ten questions on the first call and write down the answers before you compare prices.</p>
<ol><li>Which AI engines do you track, how often, and with which tool?</li><li>Can you show a client query I can run today, with the citation visible?</li><li>What is my baseline across prompts and engines before we start?</li><li>Which sources do AI tools cite in my category?</li><li>What share of the work is off-site?</li><li>How do you handle Reddit and review sites, and is participation disclosed?</li><li>How many placements, articles and fixes do I get each month?</li><li>How do you connect AI referral traffic to pipeline?</li><li>What is the price, the term and the exit clause?</li><li>Who works on my account, and in which time zone?</li></ol>
<h2 id="what-are-the-red-flags-when-hiring-an-ai-seo-company">What are the red flags when hiring an AI SEO company?</h2>
<p>Watch for six red flags: guaranteed AI rankings, no baseline, schema-only packages, filler content at volume, undisclosed community posts and anonymous results. Any one of them means you should ask for proof before you sign. AI answers vary by user, location and date, so no one controls them.</p>
<ul><li>A guaranteed spot in ChatGPT or AI Overviews.</li><li>No baseline measurement before work starts.</li><li>A package that is only schema or an llms.txt file.</li><li>"AI SEO" that means mass-produced AI blog posts.</li><li>Undisclosed Reddit accounts or fake reviews.</li><li>Results with no client name, date or query.</li></ul>
<h2 id="do-you-need-an-ai-seo-agency-or-an-ai-seo-tool">Do you need an AI SEO agency or an AI SEO tool?</h2>
<p>An AI SEO tool tracks where your brand appears. An AI SEO agency changes those answers through content, off-site citations and technical work. Teams with in-house writers and outreach capacity may only need a tool. Teams without that capacity need an agency, and most good agencies include tracking.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-ai-seo-agencies">Frequently asked questions about AI SEO agencies</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-an-ai-seo-agency">What is an AI SEO agency?</h3>
<p>An AI SEO agency optimizes your brand for Google and for AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini and Google AI Overviews. It maps buyer prompts, builds answer-first pages, earns mentions on cited sources, and tracks how often your brand appears. AI-first agencies treat AI answers as the target, not a side effect.</p>
<h3 id="which-is-the-best-ai-seo-agency">Which is the best AI SEO agency?</h3>
<p>The best AI SEO agency depends on your gap. Nakama Growth leads our checks for off-site citations on YouTube, Reddit and review sites. Breaking B2B fits pipeline-focused SaaS. Maximus Labs has the lowest published entry price. Discovered Labs offers month-to-month terms.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-best-ai-seo-agencies-in-2026">What are the best AI SEO agencies in 2026?</h3>
<p>The best AI SEO agencies in 2026, by our evidence checks on 28 October 2026, with a recheck of Breaking B2B, MADX Digital, Discovered Labs, Minuttia and Omniscient Digital on 11 November 2026, are Nakama Growth, Discovered Labs, MADX Digital, Maximus Labs, Breaking B2B, Omniscient Digital, Minuttia, NoGood and Victorious. They are ordered by checkable AI answer proof and off-site citation work first.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-does-an-ai-seo-company-cost">How much does an AI SEO company cost?</h3>
<p>Published prices on this list start at USD 3,999 a month (Maximus Labs) and run to USD 20,000 a month and above for enterprise tiers. MADX Digital starts at USD 4,500, Breaking B2B at USD 4,600 on 12 months, and Discovered Labs at EUR 6,995 on 6 months. Nakama Growth quotes after a call.</p>
<h3 id="which-ai-seo-agencies-are-best-for-b2b-saas-and-startups">Which AI SEO agencies are best for B2B SaaS and startups?</h3>
<p>For B2B SaaS startups, look at Maximus Labs and Breaking B2B for published entry tiers, MADX Digital for fixed placements, and Nakama Growth for off-site citations. Larger SaaS companies with Series B budgets can consider Minuttia or Omniscient Digital.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-does-ai-seo-take-to-work">How long does AI SEO take to work?</h3>
<p>Most agencies describe the first month as research and setup. Nakama Growth sets a three-month minimum for that reason, and MADX Digital sends first placements in month one. Expect early AI mentions within one to three months and compounding gains over six months or more.</p>
<h3 id="can-an-ai-seo-agency-guarantee-rankings-in-chatgpt">Can an AI SEO agency guarantee rankings in ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>No. No agency controls what an AI model recommends, and answers vary by user and date. MADX Digital states this on its own pricing page. Ask instead for a baseline, the prompts tracked and links to the raw answers.</p>
<h3 id="should-you-hire-an-ai-seo-agency-or-buy-a-tracking-platform">Should you hire an AI SEO agency or buy a tracking platform?</h3>
<p>A tracking platform measures your visibility in AI answers. An agency does the work that changes it: content, citations, PR and technical fixes. Several agencies here bundle a tracker, such as Maximus Labs' Max Visibility and Discovered Labs' AI Visibility Tracker.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-your-brand-stand-in-ai-answers-today">Where does your brand stand in AI answers today?</h2>
<p>The right AI SEO agency shows you, with queries you can run, where your brand appears today and what it will take to get named. Nakama Growth checks a few of your buyers' prompts before the call, then gives a clear next step: an audit, a proposal or a plain "not a fit." <a href="https://www.nakama.in/pricing">Book a 15-minute call</a>.</p>
