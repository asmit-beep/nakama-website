<p>How to rank in ChatGPT starts with one fact: ChatGPT cites pages its own search retrieves, and a top Google position predicts little about which ones. Let OpenAI's search crawler in, answer the buyer's exact question in plain words, and earn other sites that name you.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-rank-in-chatgpt">How do you rank in ChatGPT?</h2>
<p>Ranking is a loose word for ChatGPT, because its answers have no fixed positions and OpenAI's help page says placement is not guaranteed. A page appears in an answer when ChatGPT's own search retrieves it and the model chooses to cite it. Letting OAI-SearchBot crawl and answering the exact question have the strongest support.</p>
<p>Search runs on a minority of free, logged-out chats. Of 66.6 million GPT-5.6 Luna responses in August and September 2026, 14.4% triggered a web search (<a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/query-fan-out-chatgpt/">Ahrefs, 12 Oct 2026</a>). OpenAI says GPT-6 "makes better decisions about when to look something up" (<a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-6-for-everyone/">OpenAI, 7 Oct 2026</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.15033">arXiv 2610.15033</a>, a University of Toronto preprint, the authors replayed 651 questions through ChatGPT's API (GPT-5.4 nano with web search) 13 times up to 7 Oct 2026. All 22,315 cited URLs came from ChatGPT's own searches, and ChatGPT consulted about 26 pages per question to cite about 3.</p>
<p>In the preprint's replay, 97% of retrieved pages were absent from Google's top 50 for the same queries.</p>
<p>OpenAI says it introduced the first GPT-6 models for paid customers in September; GPT-6 began rolling out as ChatGPT's Chat model on 7 Oct 2026. Most data here was collected before 7 Oct.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-cited-by-chatgpt-what-does-the-evidence-say">How to get cited by ChatGPT: what does the evidence say?</h2>
<p>How to get cited by ChatGPT, on current evidence, is to make one page the closest match to how buyers phrase the question and put facts on it only you can publish. In a Toronto preprint on commercial questions about US home internet service, plus a small B2B niche, matching wording held up within websites.</p>
<p>For ChatGPT alone, one standard deviation better best-paragraph match went with 9.5% more citations, and title match had no effect (0.2% fewer). Across ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity together the figures were 15.5% and 14.1%. All come from a 143,249-answer dataset (58,590 from ChatGPT) from 24 Jun to 21 Sep 2026, in English about the US market. They are associations, and the paper is a preprint.</p>
<p>Ahrefs found official sources cited for 84.4% of factual questions and 68.3% of comparison questions in 20,000 US prompts, so put prices, plans and specifications on crawlable pages in plain text.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-the-top-google-results-for-how-to-rank-in-chatgpt-miss">What do the top Google results for how to rank in ChatGPT miss?</h2>
<p>The top Google results for how to rank in ChatGPT and how to get cited by ChatGPT mostly agree on answer-first writing and brand mentions. On 17 Oct 2026, 2 of the eight we could read still called Reddit ChatGPT's most-cited domain, 4 named OAI-SearchBot, and in our reading none graded its tactics by evidence.</p>
<p>Method: of 15 organic results Google showed on 17 Oct 2026 (set to the US, fetched from India), we left out two Reddit results, two LinkedIn results, one Medium post and one unrelated APA Style page. That left nine pages, one unreadable, last updated between 19 Nov 2025 and 16 Oct 2026.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-chatgpt-seo">What is ChatGPT SEO?</h2>
<p>ChatGPT SEO is the SEO work that helps ChatGPT's search find, read and cite your pages: crawler access, pages that answer real buyer questions, and mentions on other sites. Google's AI optimization guide says optimizing for its own generative AI features is "still SEO."</p>
<p>For definitions of AEO and GEO, see <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/aeo-vs-seo-vs-geo">AEO vs SEO vs GEO</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-make-a-page-eligible-for-chatgpt-search">How do you make a page eligible for ChatGPT search?</h2>
<p>You make a page eligible for ChatGPT search, the first step to optimize for ChatGPT, by letting OpenAI's search crawler reach it. <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9237897-chatgpt-search">OpenAI's Help Center</a> says to allow OAI-SearchBot and to confirm your host or CDN accepts traffic from OpenAI's published search IP addresses.</p>
<p>Check robots.txt and your CDN's bot protection, since robots.txt never shows CDN rules. OpenAI says it can take about 24 hours for robots.txt changes to take effect in search (<a href="https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/bots">OpenAI crawler docs</a>).</p>
<p>Blocking GPTBot is a separate choice. OpenAI says GPTBot crawls content that may be used for training, and a site can disallow it while allowing OAI-SearchBot.</p>
<p>Then rewrite the opening paragraph and title of key pages so they answer the buyer's question in the first sentence. In the preprint, title match helped Gemini and Perplexity and showed no effect for ChatGPT.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-your-brand-to-appear-in-chatgpt-answers">How do you get your brand to appear in ChatGPT answers?</h2>
<p>Your brand appears in ChatGPT answers when the model already knows it or when the pages ChatGPT reads name it. For small brands the second route matters more. In the Toronto study's small B2B software niche, the models barely knew the vendors, and answers named them mainly when a cited third-party page named them.</p>
<p>In that niche, a cited third-party page naming a vendor multiplied the odds that ChatGPT names it by 39.7, though ChatGPT cited anything in only 35% of answers. To get cited in ChatGPT more often, aim for several pages per buying question that name you; that is our inference from one niche.</p>
<p>One caution from the same preprint: at equal rank in its API replay, lists (0.54 times the odds), comparisons (0.34) and Reddit threads (0.30) were consulted often but cited rarely. Konitzny's listicle row measures something else, share of cited URLs after the GPT-6 switch.</p>
<h2 id="does-reddit-still-get-you-cited-by-chatgpt">Does Reddit still get you cited by ChatGPT?</h2>
<p>Reddit still gets cited by ChatGPT, though far less than early in 2026. In Ahrefs' data, about 1 in 5 ChatGPT answers cited Reddit in March and about 1 in 43 by late September. Google's AI Overviews for our two test queries still cited Reddit on 17 Oct.</p>
<p>In the Toronto API answers, Reddit took 2.2% of ChatGPT's citations and 13.1% of Gemini's. We found no GPT-6 Reddit figure yet and no trend data for Perplexity or Gemini.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-not-work">What does not work?</h2>
<p>What does not work for ChatGPT citations, on current evidence, is special AI schema and FAQ blocks added as a citation trick, while llms.txt and mass pages for every query variation have no evidence behind them. Keep schema accurate for the rich results Google still shows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>llms.txt.</strong> No study we found shows llms.txt affects ChatGPT citations (<a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/llmstxt-study/">Ahrefs, 15 Jun 2026</a>), and OpenAI's crawler docs list no llms.txt setting.</li>
<li><strong>Special AI schema.</strong> Google says its AI features need no special schema.org markup.</li>
<li><strong>FAQ blocks as a trick.</strong> Across websites FAQ blocks looked like 18.1% more citations; within one website the figure was 3.4% fewer and not significant, because more-cited sites use them more often. Google stopped showing FAQ rich results on 7 May 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Mass pages for every query variation.</strong> Google says making them mainly to manipulate AI responses violates its scaled content abuse policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-track-brand-mentions-in-chatgpt">How do you track brand mentions in ChatGPT?</h2>
<p>You track brand mentions in ChatGPT with a fixed set of 10 to 20 buyer prompts that do not name you, each run several times in a fresh chat. One run proves little, because the same prompt can return different brands and sources minutes apart.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write 10 to 20 unbranded prompts across category, problem and comparison questions (our suggestion).</li>
<li>Run each prompt at least 7 times per day for brand estimates and 8 for cited sources, per the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.07585">St. Gallen preprint</a>, which calls a single run essentially uninformative.</li>

<p>In that preprint, cited sources for runs within 24 hours had a mean Jaccard similarity of 0.32 to 0.43, pooled over four engines (Swiss-German prompts, Swiss servers, early 2026). For ChatGPT alone it was 0.23, and 57.8% of its runs returned no citations.</p>
<p>In GA4, links in ChatGPT's answer text reportedly lost the utm_source=chatgpt.com tag from about 8 Oct 2026 (Huesler) or 9 Oct (Graphite), so some visits can appear as Direct. Adobe's Cedric Huesler says a fix began rolling out on 15 Oct, with tagged clicks back to roughly 95 to 100% of the same hour a week earlier by 9 a.m. Pacific (<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/chatgpt-traffic-drop-appears-to-be-a-tracking-problem/593157/">Search Engine Journal, 15 Oct 2026</a>). Huesler says most ChatGPT clicks still arrive without a referrer, so count the UTM tag and annotate 8 to 15 Oct in GA4.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-first">What should you do first?</h2>
<p>What you should do first is the documented work, then the work with measured support. Fix crawler access this week, rewrite key pages around buyer questions this month, and start the third-party coverage that takes longest. Record a prompt baseline before you change anything.</p>
<ol>
<li>This week: allow OAI-SearchBot and record a prompt baseline.</li>
<li>This month: rewrite the opening paragraph and the title on your ten key pages.</li>
<li>This quarter: earn coverage on review, comparison and partner sites.</li>

<h2 id="what-do-people-ask-about-ranking-in-chatgpt">What do people ask about ranking in ChatGPT?</h2>
<p>These are the questions marketers ask most often about ranking in ChatGPT, answered in under 60 words each with the sources above. Where an answer rests on a single study, it says so. No answer here promises a position or a date, because nobody outside OpenAI can.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-chatgpt-seo-mean">What does ChatGPT SEO mean?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT SEO is the search work that lets ChatGPT's own search reach, understand and cite your pages. It covers OAI-SearchBot access, pages that match how buyers phrase questions, facts in plain text and mentions on other sites. Google describes the same kind of work for its own AI features as SEO.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-rank-in-chatgpt">Can you rank in ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>Ranking in ChatGPT has no fixed positions, since ChatGPT writes a new answer each time and the brands and sources it uses change between runs. What you can raise is how often your brand is named and your pages are cited across many runs of the same buyer questions.</p>
<h3 id="does-ranking-in-google-get-you-cited-by-chatgpt">Does ranking in Google get you cited by ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>Ranking in Google rarely gets you cited by ChatGPT on its own. In the API replay of a 2026 University of Toronto preprint, 97% of the pages ChatGPT retrieved were absent from Google's top 50 for the same searches, though about half came from websites that did appear there.</p>
<h3 id="which-openai-crawler-controls-chatgpt-search">Which OpenAI crawler controls ChatGPT search?</h3>
<p>OAI-SearchBot is the OpenAI crawler that controls ChatGPT search. Per OpenAI's crawler docs, opting out of it keeps a site out of ChatGPT search answers, apart from navigational links. GPTBot is a separate training crawler, so one robots.txt file can disallow GPTBot and still allow OAI-SearchBot.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-times-should-i-run-a-prompt">How many times should I run a prompt?</h3>
<p>Each prompt should run at least seven times per day for a stable per-brand rate, and eight when source coverage matters. A University of St. Gallen preprint derived both numbers from ten simultaneous runs per prompt, using Swiss-German prompts in early 2026. Even seven runs only separate large gaps between brands.</p>
<h3 id="why-did-chatgpt-referrals-drop-in-ga4-in-october-2026">Why did ChatGPT referrals drop in GA4 in October 2026?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT referrals in GA4 fell from about 8 Oct 2026 after links in ChatGPT's answer text reportedly lost the utm_source=chatgpt.com tag, so some visits can appear as Direct. Adobe's Cedric Huesler says a fix began rolling out on 15 Oct. Annotate 8 to 15 Oct before comparing months.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-until-i-appear-in-chatgpt">How long until I appear in ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>Appearing in ChatGPT has no promised timeline. OpenAI says robots.txt changes can take about 24 hours to take effect in search, but retrieval and citation depend on ChatGPT's own ranking, and OpenAI says placement is not guaranteed. A 2026 Toronto preprint also found cited pages drifting over weeks, so measure monthly.</p>

   "Published 17 Oct 2026. Last updated 17 Oct 2026.",
   "By Snehil Srivastava , CEO & Creative Director, Nakama Growth",
   "How to rank in ChatGPT starts with one fact: ChatGPT cites pages its own search retrieves, and a top Google position predicts little about which ones. Let OpenAI's search crawler in, answer the buyer's exact question in plain words, and earn other sites that name you.",
   "TL;DR",
   "\"Ranking\" in ChatGPT means being named or cited often across repeated runs of one question.",
   "Blocking GPTBot leaves you in ChatGPT search; opting out of OAI-SearchBot removes you, apart from navigational links.",
   "ChatGPT cited Reddit far less in 2026, though Google's AI Overviews still cited it in our 17 Oct test.",
   "ChatGPT citation tactics graded Documented (OpenAI or Google states it), Measured in a study, Practitioner report or Unproven (no evidence found); sources read 17 Oct 2026.

   "Ranking is a loose word for ChatGPT, because its answers have no fixed positions and OpenAI's help page says placement is not guaranteed. A page appears in an answer when ChatGPT's own search retrieves it and the model chooses to cite it. Letting OAI-SearchBot crawl and answering the exact question have the strongest support.",
   "Search runs on a minority of free, logged-out chats. Of 66.6 million GPT-5.6 Luna responses in August and September 2026, 14.4% triggered a web search ( Ahrefs, 12 Oct 2026 ). OpenAI says GPT-6 \"makes better decisions about when to look something up\" ( OpenAI, 7 Oct 2026 ).",
   "In arXiv 2610.15033 , a University of Toronto preprint, the authors replayed 651 questions through ChatGPT's API (GPT-5.4 nano with web search) 13 times up to 7 Oct 2026. All 22,315 cited URLs came from ChatGPT's own searches, and ChatGPT consulted about 26 pages per question to cite about 3.",
   "In the preprint's replay, 97% of retrieved pages were absent from Google's top 50 for the same queries.",
   "OpenAI says it introduced the first GPT-6 models for paid customers in September; GPT-6 began rolling out as ChatGPT's Chat model on 7 Oct 2026. Most data here was collected before 7 Oct."

In a Toronto preprint on commercial questions about US home internet service, plus a small B2B niche, matching wording held up within websites.",
   "For ChatGPT alone, one standard deviation better best-paragraph match went with 9.5% more citations, and title match had no effect (0.2% fewer). Across ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity together the figures were 15.5% and 14.1%. All come from a 143,249-answer dataset (58,590 from ChatGPT) from 24 Jun to 21 Sep 2026, in English about the US market. They are associations, and the paper is a preprint.",

In the Toronto study's small B2B software niche, the models barely knew the vendors, and answers named them mainly when a cited third-party page named them.",
   "In that niche, a cited third-party page naming a vendor multiplied the odds that ChatGPT names it by 39.7, though ChatGPT cited anything in only 35% of answers. To get cited in ChatGPT more often, aim for several pages per buying question that name you; that is our inference from one niche.",
   "One caution from the same preprint: at equal rank in its API replay, lists (0.54 times the odds), comparisons (0.34) and Reddit threads (0.30) were consulted often but cited rarely. Konitzny's listicle row measures something else, share of cited URLs after the GPT-6 switch."
