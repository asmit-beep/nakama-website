<p>The best GEO agency for SaaS companies depends on stage and budget. Our picks by buyer fit: Rock The Rankings for Series A to D teams, MADX Digital for the lowest price on a 12-month term, Nakama for off-site AI mentions, Breaking B2B for senior-led programs, and DerivateX for $5M to $50M ARR. Sites checked 21 Oct 2026.</p>
<p>In G2's April 2025 survey of 1,169 B2B software decision makers, generative AI chatbots were the top source influencing vendor shortlists, at 17.1% (<a href="https://learn.g2.com/hubfs/G2-2025-Buyer-Behavior-Report-AI-Always-Included.pdf">G2 report</a>). In that report, 79% said AI search changed how they research. If ChatGPT leaves you off the list, the demo never gets booked.</p>

<p>We checked every agency against the same five criteria, fixed before we opened any site, and read the evidence on its own pages on 21 Oct 2026. The order is an editorial pick by buyer fit. Each entry below links the pages we used and names a weakness.</p>

<h2 id="cost">How much does a GEO retainer cost for B2B SaaS?</h2>
<p>As of Oct 2026, published GEO retainers for SaaS start between $2,500 and $6,000 a month, and top tiers reach $15,000 to $20,000 or more. Two agencies on our list, Graphite and Nakama, publish no price. Published minimum terms run up to 12 months.</p>

<p>All prices checked 21 Oct 2026 on each agency's own page.</p>
<p>Three things move the number: off-site placements (sometimes billed outside the retainer), the engines and prompts tracked, and content volume.</p>
<p>For a wider benchmark, First Page Sage, an agency, reports a B2B SaaS median of $8,640 a month in its own October 2026 pricing study, built from 1,146 quotes across 214 agencies (<a href="https://firstpagesage.com/seo-blog/geo-aeo-pricing-statistics/">First Page Sage</a>).</p>
<h2 id="what-it-does">What does a GEO agency do for a SaaS company?</h2>
<p>GEO for SaaS is work on the sources AI engines read when a buyer asks "best tool for X". That means comparison pages, G2 profiles, Reddit threads, integration pages and listicles, plus checks that AI crawlers can reach your site. An agency then reruns shortlist prompts each month to see who gets named.</p>
<p>Several agencies on this list sell AEO and GEO together, so an AEO agency for SaaS often covers the same work.</p>
<p>GEO and SEO overlap heavily, since engines lean on search indexes. The difference is the goal: a mention inside the answer. Our <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/aeo-vs-seo-vs-geo">AEO vs SEO vs GEO</a> explainer covers the terms. If you want software instead, our <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/peec-ai-alternatives">Peec AI alternatives</a> guide compares prompt tracking tools.</p>

<h2 id="questions">What should you ask a GEO agency for SaaS before signing?</h2>
<p>Ask how they measure AI visibility before you discuss price. Good agencies name the engines, prompt set, runs per prompt and how mentions tie to pipeline. Then settle scope: what off-site work the retainer covers, who edits your website and how you can leave.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which engines will you watch, and how often is each prompt rerun?</li>
<li>Which of our buyer prompts will you report on each month?</li>
<li>What off-site work is in the retainer, and what is billed on top?</li>
<li>Who publishes changes to our website, you or us?</li>
<li>Which named SaaS client can I check, and over what dates?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="who-is-the-best-geo-agency-for-saas-companies">Who is the best GEO agency for SaaS companies?</h3>
<p>As of 21 Oct 2026, our editorial picks by buyer fit are Rock The Rankings, MADX Digital and Nakama, then Breaking B2B and DerivateX. Nakama is #3 for SaaS teams whose gap is off-site mentions; Arobis AI fits tight budgets and Graphite fits product-led teams.</p>
<h3 id="do-geo-agencies-for-saas-work-on-g2-and-review-sites">Do GEO agencies for SaaS work on G2 and review sites?</h3>
<p>Some do. On our list, Arobis AI includes G2 and Crunchbase consistency on its Growth plan, Breaking B2B counts review sites among its placements, and Nakama lists G2 presence in its plan. Ask whether review work means profile edits, review requests or both, and whether the retainer covers it.</p>
<h3 id="is-a-90-day-pilot-enough-to-judge-a-saas-geo-agency">Is a 90-day pilot enough to judge a SaaS GEO agency?</h3>
<p>It gives a first read. DerivateX starts its first two tiers as a 90-day pilot, and Rock The Rankings prices a 90-day program. Agree the buyer prompts, engines and baseline before day one, then compare repeated runs at day 90 against that baseline.</p>
<h3 id="can-one-geo-agency-handle-product-led-and-sales-led-saas">Can one GEO agency handle product-led and sales-led SaaS?</h3>
<p>Yes, if it measures the outcome that fits your motion. Product-led teams should ask for sign-ups from LLM referrals, as Graphite reports for Webflow. Sales-led teams should ask for pipeline tied to AI search, as Rock The Rankings and DerivateX report. Rock The Rankings says it takes both models.</p>
<h3 id="does-a-saas-geo-agency-need-access-to-our-website">Does a SaaS GEO agency need access to our website?</h3>
<p>It depends on scope. Arobis AI and DerivateX include on-site work such as schema and llms.txt, and Rock The Rankings expects your team to make technical and on-page edits. Nakama works only off-site, so your team or another agency keeps the website. Settle who publishes changes before you sign.</p>
<h3 id="should-a-saas-startup-hire-a-geo-agency-or-do-it-in-house">Should a SaaS startup hire a GEO agency or do it in-house?</h3>
<p>A seed-stage team with a writer can start in-house with a tracking tool and a short prompt list. An agency makes more sense once you need placements, PR and community work at a steady pace. Published entry retainers on our list start at $2,500 a month, as of Oct 2026.</p>
<h3 id="can-a-geo-agency-for-saas-guarantee-chatgpt-citations">Can a GEO agency for SaaS guarantee ChatGPT citations?</h3>
<p>No. AI answers change from run to run and depend on sources no agency controls. A credible agency will show a baseline, report movement over repeated runs and explain which changes it believes caused the shift, with dates attached to each change.</p>
<h3 id="which-ai-engines-matter-most-for-b2b-software-buyers">Which AI engines matter most for B2B software buyers?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT leads. In G2's August 2025 survey of more than 1,000 B2B software buyers, 47% named ChatGPT their favorite LLM, nearly three times any other (<a href="https://learn.g2.com/ai-search-surging-for-b2b-buyers">G2</a>). Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, Gemini and Claude are worth tracking too, because buyers mix engines.</p>

  "heading": "Can one GEO agency handle product-led and sales-led SaaS?",

   "Yes, if it measures the outcome that fits your motion. Product-led teams should ask for sign-ups from LLM referrals, as Graphite reports for Webflow.
