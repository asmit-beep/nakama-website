<p>The best AI visibility tools in 2026 for SaaS teams are Peec AI, Profound, OtterlyAI, the Semrush AI Visibility Toolkit, Ahrefs Brand Radar, SE Visible, LLMrefs, Scrunch and AthenaHQ. Each one runs prompts through AI assistants and reports whether your brand is mentioned, cited or recommended. Entry prices range from $29 to $295 a month. If you already use Peec AI and want to switch, see our <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/peec-ai-alternatives">Peec AI alternatives</a> guide.</p>
<p>Sources shift fast. In Ahrefs' Brand Radar data, about 1 in 5 US ChatGPT answers cited Reddit in March 2026, and by late September it was about 1 in 43 (<a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/query-fan-out-chatgpt/">Ahrefs, 12 Oct 2026</a>).</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-compare-these-ai-visibility-tools">How did we compare these AI visibility tools?</h2>
<p>We compared each tool on its published pricing, prompt limits, engines covered and reporting features. Every figure comes from the vendor's own pricing or help page, fetched on 23 Oct 2026. We did not run paid accounts for this guide, so check limits again before you buy.</p>
<p>For SaaS teams, three factors matter most.</p>
<p>The first is prompt volume, because buyer questions multiply across use cases, integrations and competitors.</p>
<p>The second is engine coverage, because your buyers may use ChatGPT for research and Google AI Overviews for quick checks.</p>
<p>The third is source data, because knowing which pages AI cites tells you where to earn mentions.</p>
<p>To set up the prompts and sources before you pick a tool, follow our <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/geo-audit">GEO audit</a> steps.</p>
<h2 id="peec-ai">Is Peec AI worth it for SaaS teams?</h2>
<p>Peec AI is a strong pick for SaaS teams that want daily tracking at a clear price. Starter costs $95/month for 50 prompts across 3 models you choose, with unlimited users. Pro costs $245/month for 150 prompts, and Advanced costs $495/month for 350 prompts.</p>
<p>Peec AI reports visibility, position, sentiment and share of voice against competitors. It also shows which domains and URLs AI retrieved, and it classifies sources as competitor, editorial, reference or UGC.</p>
<p>Extra features include a crawlability audit across 40+ AI bots and AI referral tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> API access and SSO are listed only on the custom Enterprise plan, and self-serve plans cap you at 3 models.</p>
<h2 id="profound">Is Profound good for enterprise SaaS brands?</h2>
<p>Profound suits larger SaaS companies that want deep tracking plus AI agents for marketing work. It tracks citations, sentiment, ranking and competitive presence. The Enterprise plan covers up to 9 answer engines, with single sign-on and SOC 2 listed among its features.</p>
<p>The free trial runs 50 prompts daily for 7 days across ChatGPT, Gemini and Google AI Overviews.</p>
<p>Profound also offers Agent Analytics, which tracks AI-sourced traffic through integrations such as Cloudflare, Vercel and Google Analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> No self-serve price is published for brands. Trial users also get a recommended prompt set they cannot customize.</p>
<h2 id="otterlyai">Is OtterlyAI the cheapest AI visibility tool?</h2>
<p>OtterlyAI has the lowest entry price in this list. Lite costs $29/month for 15 prompts, Standard costs $189/month for 100 prompts, and Premium costs $489/month for 400 prompts. Every plan tracks ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity and Microsoft Copilot daily.</p>
<p>OtterlyAI includes brand visibility, sentiment analysis and citation source tracking on all plans. Standard and above add full optimization recommendations and MCP access.</p>
<p>Monthly plans can be cancelled at any time, and new users get a free trial.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Claude, Google AI Mode and Gemini cost extra as add-ons, and 15 prompts on Lite is too few for most SaaS categories.</p>
<h2 id="semrush-ai-visibility-toolkit">Should Semrush users buy the AI Visibility Toolkit?</h2>
<p>The Semrush AI Visibility Toolkit makes sense if your team already works in Semrush. It costs $99/month and includes 1 project, 1 domain, 25 tracked prompts and AI search checks in Site Audit for up to 100 pages.</p>
<p>Its Prompt Research report works like keyword research for AI, with topic-level volume, difficulty and intent.</p>
<p>Prompt tracking updates daily on platforms such as Google AI Mode and ChatGPT, with coverage in 220+ countries and territories.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> There is no free trial, and 25 prompts is a small starting limit. Each extra 50 prompts costs $60/month, and each extra user needs its own $99 license.</p>
<h2 id="ahrefs-brand-radar">Is Ahrefs Brand Radar good for AI visibility tracking?</h2>
<p>Ahrefs Brand Radar is the most flexible option for SEO teams already on Ahrefs. Custom prompt tracking starts at $50/month for 2,500 checks, and paid Ahrefs plans include a small daily custom prompt quota (Lite 5, Standard 10, Advanced 20). The AI Visibility Index costs $199/month and covers 496 million prompts.</p>
<p>The index lets you check any brand's AI visibility with no setup, which helps with competitor research.</p>
<p>Brand Radar can also be bought standalone, with a free Ahrefs account included.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Tracking all models costs $699/month, and each Claude update uses 8 checks, so costs climb quickly.</p>
<h2 id="se-visible">Is SE Visible a good AI visibility tool for SaaS?</h2>
<p>SE Visible, from SE Ranking, suits SaaS teams that want a high prompt count focused on Google and ChatGPT. Basic costs from $99/month for 200 prompts and 3 projects, Core from $189/month for 450 prompts, and Plus from $355/month for 1,000 prompts. Annual billing saves 20%.</p>
<p>Every plan tracks ChatGPT, Gemini, Google AI Mode and Google AI Overviews, and new users get a 10-day free trial.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> It does not track Perplexity or Copilot, and Claude is listed as coming soon.</p>
<h2 id="llmrefs">Is LLMrefs worth it for SaaS teams?</h2>
<p>LLMrefs suits budget-conscious SaaS teams that want broad engine coverage. Its All in One plan costs $79/month, marked as limited time, and tracks 500 prompts for brand mentions, sources and fan-out queries across all AI search engines with no extra fees.</p>
<p>It includes citation tracking, geo-targeting in 50+ countries and 20+ languages, and unlimited team members. You can create a free account or start a 7-day free trial.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Reports refresh weekly, so you will see sudden drops later than with daily trackers, and the $79 price is labelled limited time.</p>
<h2 id="scrunch">Is Scrunch a good fit for growing SaaS teams?</h2>
<p>Scrunch fits SaaS teams that want a mid-priced plan with room for testing. Core costs $250/month and includes 125 unique prompts, 5 site audits a month and 5 user licenses. It tracks ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews and Copilot.</p>
<p>Scrunch offers a 7-day free trial on Core.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Core includes only 1 brand workspace and does not list Gemini or Claude among its 4 supported LLMs.</p>
<h2 id="athenahq">Is AthenaHQ worth the price?</h2>
<p>AthenaHQ suits self-guided SaaS teams that want tracking plus content help. Starter costs $295/month and includes 3,600 credits, where 1 credit equals 1 AI response. It covers 11 models, including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Google AI Mode, Gemini, Claude, Copilot and Grok, with unlimited topics and competitors.</p>
<p>AthenaHQ includes prompt volume estimates, source and competitor insights, content recommendations and an AI agent.</p>
<p>A free tier gives $25 in credit, worth 300 responses.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> It has the highest entry price here, and Starter charges extra for API access and additional credits. Credits are per AI response, so 11 models burn through 3,600 credits fast.</p>
<h2 id="what-other-ai-visibility-tools-are-worth-a-look">What other AI visibility tools are worth a look?</h2>
<p>Three more tools appear often in 2026 comparisons and publish clear prices.</p>
<p>ZipTie prices by usage, with a Starter preset from $25.65/month and 7 engines available at the same price per engine, including ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, Google AI Mode, Copilot and Gemini.</p>
<p>Rankscale starts at $20/month on Essentials, and Pro costs $99/month with 1,200 credits, covering engines such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Mode, AI Overviews, Gemini, Claude and Copilot.</p>
<p>Wellows starts at $29/month on Basic for 1,800 AI answers a month, and Standard costs $97/month for 6,500, tracked daily across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews and Google AI Mode.</p>
<h2 id="which-ai-visibility-tool-should-a-saas-company-choose">Which AI visibility tool should a SaaS company choose?</h2>
<p>Pick the tool that fits your current SEO stack and prompt count. Semrush or Ahrefs users should start with the add-on they already pay for. Teams that want a standalone tracker should compare Peec AI, OtterlyAI, SE Visible and LLMrefs. Enterprise teams with compliance needs should talk to Profound.</p>
<p>Once you are tracking, our guides on <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/how-to-rank-in-chatgpt">how to rank in ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/how-to-rank-in-google-ai-overviews">how to rank in Google AI Overviews</a> cover what to fix first.</p>
<p>Early-stage startups can start with OtterlyAI Lite or Ahrefs Brand Radar custom prompts at $50/month and grow from there.</p>
<p>Larger SaaS companies with several products, integrations and competitors will often need 100 or more prompts to cover them.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-t-ai-visibility-tools-fix">What can't AI visibility tools fix?</h2>
<p>AI visibility tools show where you are missing from AI answers. They do not earn the mentions that change those answers. Which sources AI cites also varies by engine and shifts over time. In Ahrefs' Brand Radar data, about 1 in 5 US ChatGPT answers cited Reddit in March 2026 and about 1 in 43 by late September, while Wikipedia fell from 1 in 7 answers to 1 in 35 (<a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/query-fan-out-chatgpt/">Ahrefs, 12 Oct 2026</a>). Ahrefs reads this as ChatGPT moving toward the sources that produce information, such as research bodies, regulators and brands. Use your tracker's source report to see which sites each engine cites for your prompts, engine by engine.</p>
<p>Closing that gap takes content and off-site work: pages that answer buyer questions directly, placements on the sources each engine already cites, and steady tracking to prove what moved. Our guide to <a href="https://www.nakama.in/journal/ai-visibility-report-template">what a useful visibility report shows</a> covers that last step.</p>
<p>This is the work Nakama Growth does for SaaS and AI companies, starting with an <a href="https://www.nakama.in/services/ai-visibility-audit">AI visibility audit</a>. If your tracker shows competitors winning prompts you should own, <a href="https://www.nakama.in/contact">talk to Nakama Growth</a> about a plan to close the gap.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="what-are-ai-visibility-tools">What are AI visibility tools?</h3>
<p>AI visibility tools run prompts through AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity and Google AI Overviews. They report how often your brand appears, how it is described and which sources are cited.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-best-ai-visibility-tools-for-saas">What are the best AI visibility tools for SaaS?</h3>
<p>The best AI visibility tools for SaaS teams in 2026 are Peec AI, Profound, OtterlyAI, the Semrush AI Visibility Toolkit, Ahrefs Brand Radar, SE Visible, LLMrefs, Scrunch and AthenaHQ. The right choice depends on budget, prompt volume and your existing SEO stack.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-free-ai-visibility-tool">Is there a free AI visibility tool?</h3>
<p>None of these tools has a full free plan. Profound has a 7-day trial, Scrunch has a 7-day trial on Core, SE Visible has a 10-day trial, AthenaHQ gives $25 in credit, and OtterlyAI offers a free trial. Paid Ahrefs plans include a small custom prompt quota in Brand Radar, starting at 5 prompts on Lite.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-prompts-should-a-saas-company-track">How many prompts should a SaaS company track?</h3>
<p>Start with the questions buyers ask at each stage, such as category, comparison, alternatives and integration prompts. A 25 to 50 prompt plan can fill up quickly once you add competitors and use cases, so check the cost of extra prompts before you buy.</p>
<h3 id="do-ai-visibility-tools-improve-rankings-in-ai-answers">Do AI visibility tools improve rankings in AI answers?</h3>
<p>No tool changes AI answers by itself. Tools measure visibility and point to the sources AI cites. Improving results takes content and earned mentions on those sources.</p>

   "We compared each tool on its published pricing, prompt limits, engines covered and reporting features. Every figure comes from the vendor's own pricing or help page, fetched on 23 Oct 2026. We did not run paid accounts for this guide, so check limits again before you buy.",

   "The first is prompt volume, because buyer questions multiply across use cases, integrations and competitors.",
   "The second is engine coverage, because your buyers may use ChatGPT for research and Google AI Overviews for quick checks.",
   "The third is source data, because knowing which pages AI cites tells you where to earn mentions.",

   "The free trial runs 50 prompts daily for 7 days across ChatGPT, Gemini and Google AI Overviews.",
   "Profound also offers Agent Analytics, which tracks AI-sourced traffic through integrations such as Cloudflare, Vercel and Google Analytics.",

   "AI visibility tools show where you are missing from AI answers. They do not earn the mentions that change those answers. Which sources AI cites also varies by engine and shifts over time. In Ahrefs' Brand Radar data, about 1 in 5 US ChatGPT answers cited Reddit in March 2026 and about 1 in 43 by late September, while Wikipedia fell from 1 in 7 answers to 1 in 35 (Ahrefs, 12 Oct 2026). Ahrefs reads this as ChatGPT moving toward the sources that produce information, such as research bodies, regulators and brands. Use your tracker's source report to see which sites each engine cites for your prompts, engine by engine.",
   "Closing that gap takes content and off-site work: pages that answer buyer questions directly, placements on the sources each engine already cites, and steady tracking to prove what moved. Our guide to what a useful visibility report shows covers that last step.",
   "This is the work Nakama Growth does for SaaS and AI companies, starting with an AI visibility audit. If your tracker shows competitors winning prompts you should own, talk to Nakama Growth about a plan to close the gap."
