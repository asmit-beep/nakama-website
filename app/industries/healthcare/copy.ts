  linkLabel: 'our GEO and AEO pricing guide',
 },
 {
  q: 'How long before we see movement in AI answers?',
  a: 'Most teams start with an audit and a 90 day plan. Early work is baseline prompts, source of truth pages and claim review; citation and mention movement usually follows once those foundations are live.',
 },
 {
  q: 'How do you handle HIPAA and privacy?',
  a: 'We treat compliance as a process, not a badge. No PHI in tracking or prompt logs, claim review before public copy ships, and clear ownership of who approves health claims on your side.',
 },
 {
  q: 'Can you guarantee ChatGPT will mention us?',
  a: 'No. No agency can guarantee mentions in ChatGPT or any other AI answer. We measure mentions, citations and recommendations separately and work the sources engines already trust.',
 },
 {
  q: 'How is GEO different from a healthcare SEO firm?',
  a: 'A healthcare SEO firm focuses on rankings and clicks. GEO and AEO focus on whether AI answers name, cite or recommend you on the same buyer questions. If you compared healthcare SEO firms, medical industry SEO services, or the best seo agency for healthcare, classic rankings still matter; this page is about what AI answers say about you.',
 },
 {
  q: 'Which AI engines do you cover?',
  a: 'Typical coverage includes ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google AI Overviews, with Gemini or Claude added when your buyers use them. Scope is set per engagement, not as a fixed public list.',
 },
 {
  q: 'Which markets do you work in?',
  a: 'Nakama Growth can work with healthcare and healthtech brands that publish for buyers in the US, UK and EU, the Middle East, APAC, and India. We match claim and disclosure rules to the markets you publish in.',
 },
 {
  q: 'Is this a fit for clinics and for healthtech?',
  a: 'Yes for both when you have clear buyer prompts and a willingness to review claims. Clinics and provider groups need local and service answers; healthtech needs comparison and category prompts. Pure ad buying or patient volume guarantees are not a fit.',
 },
 {
  q: 'Who are the best GEO agencies for healthcare brands?',
  a: 'There is no single public ranking every health brand should trust. Look for a healthcare GEO agency that maps your buyer prompts, runs claim review before publish, and measures mentions, citations and recommendations separately. Nakama Growth does that work for health brands that publish across the US, UK and EU, the Middle East, APAC, and India.',
