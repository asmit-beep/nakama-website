 ['What is the difference between a mention and a citation?', 'A mention is your brand named in the answer. A recommendation is the engine suggesting you as an option. A citation is your page linked as a source. We count all three separately because one can happen without the others.'],
 ['How is this different from a free AI visibility grader?', 'Most graders run a prompt once and return a single score. We repeat runs, report each engine on its own, show the exact answers and sources, and hand you a ranked fix list with a walkthrough call.'],
 ['What do you need from us?', 'Your site, the buyer prompts you care about, and the competitors you want to compare against. If you are unsure about prompts, we draft a set with you before any runs.'],

 ['Which engines do you check?', 'The paid audit covers the engines agreed for your audit, each reported separately. The free AI visibility check uses 2 engines.'],
