## How an engagement runs

1. Understand (weeks 1–2): map the prompts buyers use across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini and Google; audit competitors and sources; agree a 90-day plan.
2. Create (weeks 2–4): answer-first articles, comparisons, buyer guides, video scripts and community answers, reviewed by the client before publishing.
3. Place (month 2 onward): publish across Reddit, Quora, YouTube, Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, G2 and editorial sources.
4. Prove (monthly): re-run prompts, report citations and mentions by engine and prompt, agree next moves.

## Documented client placements

Captured when each placement went live; live answers vary by location, account and date.
